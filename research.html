					<h2>Our Staff and Founders</h2>
					

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Mentorupstatefounders.jpeg" alt="Photo of Frazee Founders" /></span>These are the members (first image) and founders (second image) of the Frazee Center. Jenny and Matt Reeves are the head organizers and leaders of this organization.</p>
				
					<p>In 2006, Jenny and Matt Reeves and several like minded families wanted to make a difference in the lives of children. An after school program began in the gym and renovated classrooms of the historic Central Baptist Church on Pinckney Street with ten children from the adjacent neighborhood. By 2016, the center averaged 140 students attending daily ranging in age from 3-15 with year round programming, academic assistance, athletics, and meals offered to them free of charge. Over the years, the building itself became an "open door" community center for local organizations that shared in the mission of positively impacting children and young adults. YouthBASE, GOAT, City Youth Sports, AAU Basketball and newly founded PMAC and GirlUp GVL are just a few of the non profits that have woven in and out of Frazee's fabric and shared space on Pinckney.</p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Staffprofiles.png" alt="Photo of Frazee Founders" /></span>The ability to keep the doors open for so many was made possible by partnerships with countless civic organizations, businesses, churches, youth groups, high schools, middle schools, college students, families and dedicated volunteers from all over the country that have freely given of their time and resources. Frazee's history is the story of these individuals that are far too many to name and the generous donors that have supported this endeavor so faithfully through the years.</p>

					<p>Mentor Upstate is one of our main programs established through the Frazee Center. Its purpose is to promote the establishment and development of mentoring partnerships in elementary, middle, and high schools in the upstate of South Carolina. </p>

					<h3>The Role</h3>
					<p>Mentors pursue an intentional friendship with a student at a local school in an effort to influence positive behavior.</p>

					<h3>The Commitment</h3>
					<p>Mentors meet with a student once a week during lunch or breakfast for the academic calendar year.
					Average time is 30-45 minutes.</p>

					<h3>The Benefits</h3>
					<p>Students with a consistent role model have statistically shown improvements in academic performance and school attendance, a decrease in disciplinary issues, and tend to display an overall more positive attitude about life, school and future choices.</p>

					<p>Synopsis of Mentor Upstate and their recruitment.</p>

					<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clb">Concentration of Public School Students Eligible for Free or Reduced-Price Lunch</a>

					<p>Low-poverty schools are defined as public schools where 25.0 percent or less of the students are eligible for FRPL; mid-low poverty schools are those where 25.1 to 50.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL; mid-high poverty schools are those where 50.1 to 75.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL; and high-poverty schools are those where more than 75.0 percent of the students are eligible for FRPL.</p>
					<p>Little things we may not immediately consider such as whether a child is eligible for free lunch is a strong indication of how poverty affects their educational experience. If a child gaurdian is unable to afford their lunch, then most likely they stuggle to place all other meals on the table for their kids. Just going hungry alone can prohibit children from being able to concentrate on their studies comparitively to a well-norished child. </p>
