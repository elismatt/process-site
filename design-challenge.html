					<h2>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h2>
					<p>Kids with a low-income background whom are currently enrolled in school, struggle to have the proper resources or motivation to complete their education with a GED. The Frazee Center supports this need through various programs throughout the Upstate, but would like to increase our resources to become more accessible to more people within our community.  </p>
					<h2>Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h2>
					<p>We want enrolled, low-income children to recieve the quality education they deserve to support their potential future endeavors.</p>
					<h2>What are some possible solutions t your problem?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Better marketing of resources</li>
						<li>Improved website</li>
						<li>Better displays of info within schools</li>
						<li>More funding to support increasing needs within communities</li>
						<li>More volunteers</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>What are some of the context and constraints that you're facing?</h2>
					<p>It is up to the parents to take advantage of these programs for their kids. Many of these programs are limited to the volunteers and the space within the physical organization.</p>
					<h2>Reframing original question.</h2>
					<p>How can we extend more opportunities to strengthening the low-income children's education through the resources of the Frazee Center?</p>
