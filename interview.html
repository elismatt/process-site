						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">These are the interviews of Jenny Reeves and Heidi Matthews who are both involved in the Frazee Center with two very different roles.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Interview of Jenny Reeves</h2>

<h4>What is your role at the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>Director of the Frazee Center and founder.</p>

<h4>How did you and your husband found the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>Matt (Jenny’s husband) sold his business to fund the nonprofit in 2006. We used to do FCA camps over the summer and we thought about doing an after-school program for the kids in the neighborhood and eventually it became a full-time gig. Showing them how to work hard and respect authority became a priority and we felt called to make a difference in the community of poverty and just different backgrounds. Its generational and deeply layered problems and it was not a quick fix, so it deserved our full attention. Once we met the kids, we knew there was so much that could be given to them. We were given a good hand in life and they weren’t, so we made the leap to try and correct the gap between us.</p>

<h4>What is the organization’s overall mission/goal? </h4>
<p>Teach the importance in life to work hard, respect authority, love everyone, and forgive quickly. It establishes peace in your life and makes our community better. </p>

<h4>What does the future look like for the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>Our mentoring program along with the preschool program is growing, and we are getting them up and running. H2O is built on my property and it’s becoming a greater need than we were expecting. New property, and partnering with Girl Up Greenville, and pouring into staff and programs is our current focus. </p>

<h4>How do you implement good leadership skills in your role here?</h4>
<p>I am a mom and I have raised two great kids. I must know how to bridge the gap and the working class of America without offending either side. I try my best to connect with people and attempt to make their lives better while I am involved in their lives now. You always can be more generous with your time and can always value everyone. And grow from your mistakes, we may have safety nets and these kids and community may not. You just have to be aware of your place in this environment and how to extend yourself to be a servant leader in every scenario.</p>

<h4>What is the organization’s primary target in the community?</h4>
<p>Moms with little ones, elementary students specifically, children that need an extra healthy adult in their life. People that may not have adequate housing for hygiene reasons.</p>

<h4>How are you making more people aware of your mission in the community?</h4>
<p>I never turn down an opportunity to talk about my mission with everyone. We are active on social media, but we don’t market ourselves too much. I rely more on personal connections to reach those in need.</p>

<h4>Do you think that website is effective for reaching your indented audience?</h4>
<p>It is very simple, and it gets the job done. It is not my strong suit, but I think it is effective in getting the information across.  </p>

<h4>Would you ever consider updating any of your design elements in your branding? Such as colors, logos, etc.? </h4>
<p>Branding is not a strong part of our program. It is very important to keep our brand and our mission consistent and simple. We stay mostly digital to save money and stay up to date. </p>

<h4>Is the website, and other social media platforms managed together?</h4>
<p>I manage all the platforms. I wear many hats in this organization so I usually do not prioritize this aspect. </p>

<h4>Can there be more information added to the current website?</h4>
<p>I try to update it as much as I have time for, but I think additional photos could be included. I have a lot and I need to consider making some changes. Otherwise, most of our specifics are there for each program and we recommend just contacting us if there are any further questions.</p>

<h4>How do you receive donations currently? And is it through the website today?</h4>
<p>Funded 100% by the public. Churches, families, no federal or state funding, fundraisers. Partially through website, and also direct donations at our location.</p>

<h4>How do you connect with schools and families that could potentially participate in your programs?</h4>
<p>We typically reach them in person. We make a stronger impression and can demonstrate our work in the community first hand. </p>

<h4>What other organizations are associated with the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>Girl Up Greenville is partnered and run separately but both share space and resources. PMAC is another (Poe Mill Achievement Center) along with New Space which used to be housed at the Frazee Center. </p>


<h2>Interview of Heidi Matthews, Current User</h2>

<h4>What is your connection with the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>I am currently a volunteer as a part of the Mentor Upstate program. Specifically, the Mentor Anderson Division.</p>

<h4>How long have you been a mentor?</h4>
<p>I have mentored Annelysie since she was in first grade, so 8 years. </p>

<h4>Have you ever visited their website before? </h4>
<p>I have.</p>

<h4>What was your first impression? </h4>
<p>I didn’t appreciate the visual aspects of it. It is easy to navigate, but I would appreciate a more information explaining the roles of this program and how to get involved. The graphics are okay, but don’t necessarily draw you in. </p>

<h4>What is the role of Mentor Upstate?</h4>
<p>To plug in adults to spend time with kids. Just spending a few hours a week with them can help guide them through obstacles they may face as they get older. Sometimes these kids have no role models or even parents to look up too, so it is our responsibility to love and lead them the best we can.</p>

<h4>How did you first hear about the Frazee Center?</h4>
<p>Someone came to talk to church about it a long time ago. </p>

<h4>Did your church partner with them?</h4>
<p>Yes they did. </p>

<h4>What church do you attend? </h4>
<p>Our church is called Community Bible Church. We have hosted many events supporting the Mentor Upstate kids and their mentors.</p>

<h4>Did the Frazee Center get you involved with Mentor Upstate?</h4>
<p>It was through our church and Kenny Gilliland’s reference. He is the one that first founded the Mentor Upstate program.</p>

<h4>What do you hope to see happen within the program in the future?</h4>
<p>I hope to see the program connect mentors with other mentor’s kids that are of similar ages to create a stronger network. Also, for their teachers to be notified more of our involvement in their schools so we can communicate and encourage and prepare our kids to be the best that they can be. I think that if the mentors could have more scheduled events together, we could be more encouraged and engaged in our commitment to these kids. </p>

<h4>What have been your biggest challenges?</h4>
<p> Sometimes it can be very challenging to feel like you are making positive impact when the kids are resistant to open up to you about their personal lives. We have dedicated a lot of time into establishing relationships with these kids and it’s hard to watch them be resistant to telling us the truth. Covid also impacted us greatly and we lost a lot of personal time together. </p>
